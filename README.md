# A Markov Decision Process approach to optimizing cancer therapy using multiple treatment modalities

There are several different modalities, e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, that are currently used to treat cancer. It is common practice to use a combination of these modalities to maximize clinical outcomes, a balance between maximizing tumor damage and minimizing normal tissues toxicity due to treatment. However, multi-modality treatment policies are mostly empirical in current practice, and therefore subject to individual clinicians’ experiences and intuition. We present a novel formulation of optimal multi-modality cancer management using a finite-horizon Markov decision process approach. Specifically, at each decision epoch the clinician chooses an optimal treatment modality based on the patient’s observed state, which we define as a combination of tumor progression and normal tissue side effect. Treatment modalities are categorized as (1) Type 1, which has a high risk and high reward but can be implemented only once during the course of treatment; (2) Type 2, which has a lower risk and lower reward than Type 1 but may be repeated; and (3) Type 3, no treatment (surveillance), which is the only action that has the possibility of reducing normal tissue side effect at the risk of worsening tumor progression. Numerical simulations using various intuitive reward functions show the structural insights of optimal policies and the potential benefits of using a rigorous model for optimal multi-modality cancer management.
